## <b> Project : Book Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering

### <b> Description: 
        This is a Jupyter notebook file containing Python code for a book recommendation system. It first imports necessary libraries and reads in three datasets: BX-Books.csv, BX-Users.csv, and BX-Book-Ratings.csv.
        the code creates a recommendation system based on rating count and another based on correlation using Pearson's R correlation coefficient. The system based on correlation is built using collaborative filtering with the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
